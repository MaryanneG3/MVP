## üß† Inspiration

This app was inspired by my father ‚Äî a boilermaker by trade who runs a trailer hire-pool ‚Äî who often wasted time manually comparing prices and stock availability across multiple supplier websites. This process was frustrating, time-consuming, and often unreliable when prices changed last minute. TML NZ was created to solve that inefficiency and help tradies get quotes and invoices faster with up-to-date info.
